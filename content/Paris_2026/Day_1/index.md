Our trip got off to a rocky start when the [Eurostar](https://www.eurostar.com/rw-en) was delayed by two hours, but that frustration vanished the moment we checked into the [Drawing House Hotel](https://www.drawinghouse.com/en/). The reception staff were incredibly welcoming, and the room was excellent. Despite the late hour, we enjoyed a relaxing dinner where the service remained warm and attentive.

The next morning began with a lovely breakfast before we headed to the Musée de l’Orangerie. Navigating Paris was a breeze thanks to the [Bonjour RATP app](https://www.ratp.fr/en/node/37345) and the convenience of having our Navigo cards right on our phones.

The highlight of the museum visit was the "[Berthe Weill: Art Dealer of the Parisian Avant-Garde](https://www.musee-orangerie.fr/en/whats-on/exhibitions/berthe-weill-art-dealer-parisian-avant-garde)" exhibition.  This is a temporary exhibition ending on 26th January 2026. It was fascinating to learn about a woman who played such a pivotal role in modern art, yet remains relatively unsung. Of course, seeing [Monet’s Water Lilies](https://www.musee-orangerie.fr/fr/collection/les-nympheas-de-claude-monet) in person was a uniquely immersive experience.

We spent the afternoon in St-Germain, enjoying a delicious lunch and the vibrant atmosphere at [Les Deux Magots](https://lesdeuxmagots.fr/en/), before ending our day on a sweet note with crepes at [BRUTUS - Gaîté](https://www.brutus-creperies.com). It was a truly satisfying day from start to finish.
