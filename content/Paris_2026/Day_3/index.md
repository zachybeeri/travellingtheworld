The day began with breakfast at [Grand Café Capucines](https://www.legrandcafe.com), an iconic Parisian brasserie that has graced the Grands Boulevards since its inauguration in 1875. Located in the heart of the 9th arrondissement, directly opposite the Opéra Garnier, it offers a quintessential Parisian experience with a blend of historical charm and modern elegance.

&nbsp;

A trip to Paris is never complete without a visit to [Galeries Lafayette](https://www.galerieslafayette.com). Its magnificent dome is a masterpiece of Art Nouveau architecture and an enduring symbol of Parisian heritage.

We enjoyed a modest lunch at [Le Relais Paris Opéra](https://le-relais-paris-opera.menustic.com) before joining the guided tour of the [Opéra Garnier](https://www.operadeparis.fr/en/visits/palais-garnier). The tour is highly recommended and includes highlights such as:

- **The Grand Staircase** – a white marble marvel that once served as the ultimate “see and be seen” spot for Parisian high society
- **The Grand Foyer** – inspired by the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, adorned with gold leaf and glittering chandeliers
- **Marc Chagall’s Ceiling** – a vibrant modern contrast to the classical auditorium, depicting scenes from famous operas
- **The Library-Museum** – home to three centuries of opera history, including set models and costumes

We ended the day at [Le Tagine](https://www.letagine-restaurant.com), an iconic Moroccan restaurant in the 11th arrondissement that has been a beloved neighborhood fixture for over 40 years.

&nbsp;

It was another perfect day in Paris.
