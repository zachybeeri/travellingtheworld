The hotel breakfast did not disappoint today, either. Afterward, we set off to visit [Notre-Dame](https://www.notredamedeparis.fr) to admire the cathedral following the restoration that succeeded the 2019 fire.

Notre-Dame de Paris is a world-renowned medieval Gothic cathedral located on the Île de la Cité. A symbol of both Paris and France, it is famous for its stunning architecture, its significant history—including Napoleon's coronation—and its role as the seat of the Archdiocese of Paris. The cathedral recently reopened in late 2024 after extensive reconstruction following the devastating 2019 fire that destroyed its spire and roof.

From there, we walked along the Rue de Rivoli and Rue Saint-Honoré until we arrived at the [Place Vendôme](https://parisjetaime.com/eng/transport/place-vendome-p1970). Situated just north of the Jardin des Tuileries in the 1st arrondissement, the square was originally designed to rival the Place des Vosges in the Marais district. The Vendôme Column at the center of the square was erected by Napoleon I to commemorate the Battle of Austerlitz. Today, Place Vendôme is renowned for its beautiful architecture and its collection of **high-end fashion and jewelry boutiques**.

Finally, it was time to head to Gare du Nord to catch our train back to the UK.
